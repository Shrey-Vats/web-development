# ðŸ§  Devvolution - Day 18

## What I Did Today

Today was a solid hands-on coding day! I spent over **5 hours** working on a **demo project** to implement and reinforce everything Iâ€™ve learned over the past 2 days.

## Concepts Practiced
- `useState` â€” managing local component state
- `useEffect` with **cleanup functions** â€” understanding component lifecycle
- **Props** â€” data flow between components
- Component structuring and reusability
- Code organization and best practices

## Reflection
I realized that applying concepts in a real project is the best way to retain and deeply understand them. The bugs, the refactoring, and the testing really solidified my learning.

## Next Step
I'll be enhancing this demo with additional React features like **conditional rendering**, **lifting state**, and **custom hooks**.

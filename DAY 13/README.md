## 📅 Day 13 – Course Selling App Backend (Part 1)

### ✅ What I Did Today:
Started building the backend for a **Course Selling App** that supports both **users** and **admins**.

### 🛠️ Features Implemented:
- Defined 4 core Mongoose schemas:
  1. **User** – For customer registration and login
  2. **Admin** – For uploading and managing courses
  3. **Course** – Course data created by admins
  4. **Purchase** – Tracks which courses users buy

- Built using:
  - **Express** – Server and route handling
  - **MongoDB + Mongoose** – Database and schema design
  - **Zod** – Input validation
  - **bcrypt** – Password hashing
  - **dotenv** – Environment variable management

### 🧠 Focus:
- Applied **best practices** in route structure and schema organization
- Modularized code for scalability

### 🚧 What's Next:
- 🔄 **Part 2** tomorrow – Complete course buying logic and secure routes
- 🚀 Starting **React** the day after tomorrow!

# ðŸ“… Day 20 of #Devvolution

## ðŸ”¥ Topics Explored
Today, I dived deeper into advanced concepts of **React.js**. Here's what I explored and implemented:

### ðŸ”¸ Conditional Rendering
- Used logical &&, ternary operators, and `if/else` logic to conditionally render components based on state.

### ðŸ”¸ Children Props
- Understood how to pass JSX or components as children to create reusable UI blocks.

### ðŸ”¸ Lists and Keys
- Learned how to render lists dynamically using `.map()` and the importance of setting `key` props for performance.

### ðŸ”¸ Class-Based vs Functional Components
- Compared class-based and functional components.
- Observed differences in syntax, lifecycle methods, and usage of hooks.

### ðŸ”¸ Lifecycle Events
- Implemented component lifecycle logic using both `useEffect` (functional) and lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` (class-based).

### ðŸ”¸ Error Boundaries
- Implemented error boundaries using class components to catch rendering errors.

### ðŸ”¸ React Fragment
- Used `<React.Fragment>` and shorthand `<>...</>` to avoid unnecessary DOM wrappers.

## ðŸ’» Practical Implementation
I built multiple mini-components to experiment with these features and added them to a test dashboard interface.

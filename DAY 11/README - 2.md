## 📅 Day 11 (Part 2) – Backend Setup for TODO App with MongoDB & Auth

### ✅ What I Did Today:
Built a **fully functional backend server** for the TODO app using the following technologies:

- **MongoDB** – For database storage  
- **Express** – For server and routing  
- **dotenv** – To manage environment variables securely  
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)** – For authentication and route protection

### 🗂️ Schemas Implemented:
1. **User Schema** – Stores user credentials and authentication info  
2. **TODO Schema** – Stores user-specific todo tasks

### 🎯 Goals for Tomorrow:
- Integrate **Zod** for request and schema validation  
- Refactor and organize the database logic in a more modular and maintainable way  
- **Complete the implementation of some remaining route handlers**

---

The backend foundation is solid—next step is making it cleaner, safer, and fully functional. 💪

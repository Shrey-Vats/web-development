## 📅 Day 13 (Part 2) – Completed TODO App Frontend

### ✅ What I Did Today:
Continued work on the TODO app I started on Day 12 by completing the **frontend interface** and integrating it with the backend.

### 💻 Frontend Highlights:
- Built a clean and responsive UI with **HTML + CSS**
- Added **Axios** for making API requests
- Handled user login, signup, and todo operations (add/delete/edit)
- Created an intuitive flow between authentication and todo dashboard

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Axios, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Backend:** Already built using Express, MongoDB, Zod, JWT, bcrypt in *DAY 12*

Now the TODO app is a fully functional full-stack project!  
Next step: learn and rebuild it in **React**. ⚛️🔥

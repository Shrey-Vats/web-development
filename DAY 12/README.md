## 📅 Day 12 – Advanced Validation, Secure Auth & Error Handling

### ✅ What I Did Today:
Today, I built a more secure and production-ready backend using the following technologies:

- **Express** – For routing and handling server logic  
- **MongoDB** – For storing users and data using Mongoose  
- **Zod** – For advanced schema-based validation  
- **bcrypt** – For password hashing and salting  
- **dotenv** – For managing environment variables

### 🔍 Key Highlights:
- Deep dive into **Zod** for validating request payloads with custom schemas  
- Implemented **password hashing and salting** using `bcrypt` to secure credentials  
- Wrapped all major logic in **`try-catch` blocks** for robust error handling  
- Sent clean and consistent responses using proper `res.status().json()` patterns  
- Backend is now **fully validated and secure** from end to end

### 🚧 What’s Missing:
- Frontend integration  
- Proper **email-based OTP verification** for signup/login

The backend is now clean, secure, and production-ready—just waiting on frontend and email verification to complete the flow! 🔐🚀

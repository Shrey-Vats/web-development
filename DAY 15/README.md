## ðŸ“… Day 15 â€“ Skill Polishing & Updated Plan

### ðŸ§  What I Did Today:
Today was a light day focused on **refining logic** and **polishing code** in my previous projects. I took time to revisit and improve key areas such as:

- Refactoring backend logic for better readability  
- Validating edge cases  
- Reviewing API responses and flow

### ðŸ“Œ About React:
Although I had planned to start learning **React** today, Iâ€™ve decided to **postpone it to June 2nd** due to my upcoming exam on **June 1st**.

Even on slower days, progress is progress. Taking a step back today to move stronger ahead! ðŸš€

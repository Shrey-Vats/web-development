## 📅 Day 10 – CORS Setup & Frontend Routing Based on Auth State

### ✅ What I Did Today:
1. Learned about **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and properly implemented it to enable secure communication between the frontend and backend.
2. Improved the frontend routing logic:
   - If the user is **not signed in**, they are shown the **Signup page**
   - If the user is **signed in**, they are redirected to the **User Information page**
3. Organized the application into clean, separate pages for Signup, Signin, and User Info

### 🎯 Goals for Tomorrow:
I plan to start building a complete **Full Stack TODO App** with the following features:
- ✅ Add TODO
- ❌ Delete TODO
- ✏️ Edit TODO

---

Making great progress! Tomorrow will be focused on building real-world CRUD functionality. 💻🔥

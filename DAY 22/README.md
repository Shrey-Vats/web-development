# Day 22 | React Custom Hooks & State Management 🚀

Welcome to Day 22 of my #Devvolution journey — building real-world React projects by mastering the core concepts one day at a time!

## 🔍 What I Learned Today:

### ✅ Custom React Hooks (📦)
- 🔁 **`usePrevious`**: Tracks the previous value of a state or prop.
- 🌐 **`useFetch`**: A robust data-fetching hook with re-fetching support.
- 📡 **`useIsOnline`**: Checks real-time internet connection status.
- ⏱️ **`useDebounce`**: Adds delay to value updates to improve performance.

### 🧠 Advanced React Concepts
- 🔄 **Rolling Up the State**: Centralizing state for better control and minimal prop drilling.
- ⚠️ **Unoptimal Re-renders**: Identified what causes unnecessary renders & how to avoid them.
- 📤 **Prop Drilling**: Faced the pain of passing props deeply.
- 🌐 **Context API**: Solved prop drilling by sharing global state across components.

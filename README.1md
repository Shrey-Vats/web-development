## ðŸ“… Day 8 â€“ Authentication Backend with Express, JWT, and Zod

Hello everyone!

On **Day 8** of my web development journey, I applied the knowledge from **Day 6** and **Day 7** to build a simple authentication backend using:

- **Express** â€“ Server framework for handling routes and middleware  
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** â€“ For secure authentication  
- **Zod** â€“ For validating request data and ensuring input correctness

### âœ… What I Did:
- Created routes for user signup and login  
- Implemented JWT-based authentication  
- Used Zod to validate incoming data for better error handling and security

### ðŸ”œ Whatâ€™s Next:
I plan to build a frontend for this backend and work on making the project more scalable and production-ready.

Thanks for following along!

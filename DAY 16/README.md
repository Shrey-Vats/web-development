### ðŸ“… Day 16 - June 10, 2025

> **Note:** Day 15 ended on May 29, 2025 â€” but due to continuous delays, I'm finally continuing today. Honestly, it's been a bit embarrassing for me as a beginner to lose that momentum.  

During this break, I worked on several other projects, but deep down I knew I had to get back to this learning journey â€” and this time, with 100% commitment. No more skipping. No more excuses. From now on, Iâ€™ll give my best, level up my skills, and focus fully on my career growth.

### âœ… Todayâ€™s Progress
- Explored **under-the-hood concepts of React**
- Learned:
  - How React works internally
  - Why React is needed
  - What problems it solves
- Implemented some foundational code to test these concepts

---

### ðŸ”œ Tomorrowâ€™s Plan
- Build a **To-Do Application** from scratch to apply what I learned
- Focus on component structure, state management, and reusability

> Letâ€™s restart stronger. No turning back now. Consistency > motivation.

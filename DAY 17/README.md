# 📅 Day 17 – React Core Concepts | #Devvolution

Welcome to Day 16 of my **#Devvolution** journey – a path toward mastering full-stack development and Web3!

Today’s focus was on diving deep into **React fundamentals**. Here's a summary of what I learned and implemented:

## 📘 Concepts Covered

- **🔹 useState** – Managing dynamic state in functional components
- **🔹 useEffect** – Performing side effects like data fetching and timers
- **🔹 Cleanup Functions** – Preventing memory leaks from intervals and subscriptions
- **🔹 Conditional Rendering** – Rendering components based on dynamic conditions
- **🔹 Component Structure & Props** – Breaking UI into reusable parts and passing data
- **🔹 Event Handling** – Handling user interactions like clicks and input

## 🚀 Learning Outcome

I'm beginning to see how the **React lifecycle** works and how to manage side effects effectively. The idea of **thinking in components** is becoming more natural.

Every day, I’m getting closer to mastering **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and eventually diving into **Solana** and **Web3**. Onward! 🔥

## 📅 Day 12 Practice – Full Stack TODO App (Frontend + Backend)

### ✅ What I Built Today:
Created a full stack TODO app featuring:

- **Backend:**  
  - **Mongoose** for MongoDB interactions  
  - **CORS** for cross-origin resource sharing  
  - **Zod** for input validation  
  - **bcrypt** for secure password hashing  
  - **Express** for routing and server logic  
  - **dotenv** for environment variable management  
  - **JWT** for authentication and session management  

- **Frontend:**  
  - Built with **HTML** and **CSS** for a clean and beautiful user interface

### ⚠️ What’s Missing:
- JavaScript functionality on the frontend (to be implemented tomorrow)  
- React integration planned in the coming days to enhance the frontend further

This is a solid foundation for a TODO app, combining a logical backend with an appealing UI. Excited to add frontend interactivity and React soon! 🚀

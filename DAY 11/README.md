## 📅 Day 11 – MongoDB Integration with User and TODO Schemas

### ✅ What I Did Today:
1. Learned the basics of **MongoDB** and how it works.
2. Integrated MongoDB into the authentication backend.
3. Created two schemas using Mongoose:
   - **User Schema**
   - **TODO Schema**

These schemas allow persistent storage of user credentials and todo items in the database.

### 🎯 Goals for Tomorrow:
- Secure user authentication by hashing passwords with **bcrypt**
- Add **Zod** validation to ensure data integrity and input validation

The project is shaping up into a solid full-stack application! 🛠️
